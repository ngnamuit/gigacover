# INTRO
sample-python-api is a RestAPIs.
I used Flask, Flask-RESTPlus, flask_sqlalchemy and  flask_jwt_extended  to support for quickly building REST APIs.
Flask-RESTPlus is an extension for Flask. It provides a coherent collection of decorators and tools to describe your API and expose its documentation properly using Swagger.
flask_sqlalchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to the application.
flask_jwt_extended is an JWT for authorization requests send to sample-python-api.
